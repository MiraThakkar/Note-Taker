# Note-Taker
# Unit 11 Express Homework: Note Taker

## Description

. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.


* The following HTML routes are created:

  * GET `/notes` - returns the `notes.html` file.

  * GET `*` -  returns the `index.html` file

* The application has a `db.json` file on the backend that is used to store and retrieve notes using the `jsonFile` module.

* The following API routes are created:

  * GET `/api/notes` - Reads the `db.json` file and returns all saved notes as JSON.

  * POST `/api/notes` - recieves a new note to save on the request body, adds it to the `db.json` file, and then returns the new note to the client.

  * DELETE `/api/notes/:id` - recieves a query paramter containing the id of a note to delete. It gives each note a unique `id` when it's saved. In order to delete a note, it reads all notes from the `db.json` file, removes the note with the given `id` property, and then rewrites the notes to the `db.json` file.
